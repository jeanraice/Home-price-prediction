# Home-price-prediction
The data used for this project is on this url : "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston"
With a collection of data we will see how machine learning algorithm is better for help us to predict the home price.
We will use the library like sklearn to find the best corroletion between the data_set we have and the data_set we have to predict. After that 
we will see the plot the graph between the data which can help us to have a best prediction and the data set to predict.
On this graph we'll apply machine learning algorithms like : linear regression to see if the are linerly corrolated.If there are not, we will use the not linear regression algorithms like SVM and Random Forest.
